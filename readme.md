This is a hugo template I made for myself because I wanted something that is minimal and easy to configure.  
This template is made by possible by adding features/layout from other templates too.  
Fork this and you can make changes to this as you like.

Huge thanks to [Eric Murphy](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz) for providing a starter template his template made tinkering with hugo a lot easier,
also thanks to [Luke Smith](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz) for his amazing tutorials.
