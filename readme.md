This is a hugo template I made for myself because I wanted something that is minimal and easy to configure.  
It has been made possible by using other templates for references so a huge thanks to them.
Fork this and you can make changes to this as you like.

Use ```generate_icons.sh``` to generate compressed images for website logo and such.  

Check example/ out to see list of available parameters for this site.
